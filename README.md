An Enterprise Class Open Source Online Business Suite - Written in C# and .NET Core MVC

Thanks for being interested in Cortex. Cortex is an open source project that's been in development since the early versions of .NET MVC. It was a 4 year passion project of mine to build something scalable, powerful, and most importantly very effective and useful for businesses. I just recently decided to update it to .NET Core 2 and subsequently make the project open source so that all could use it for whatever purposes they desire. 

Cortex is a multi-site web architecture focused on ecommerce, business marketing and sales. For scalability, it's built to be tightly integrated with Amazon AWS, offering CDN for files, bulk email sending services and more.
